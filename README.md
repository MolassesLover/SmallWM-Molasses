This is a free and open-source window manager forked from 
[Adam Marchetti](https://github.com/adamnew123456)'s
'[SmallWM](https://github.com/adamnew123456/SmallWM)' project.
It most notably uses CMake instead of Doxygen. Other than that the changes are
very minimal. This isn't a serious project, just something I personally use for
my desktop [rice](https://github.com/MolassesLover/dots).
