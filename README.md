This is a free and open-source window manager forked from 
[Adam Marchetti](https://github.com/adamnew123456)'s
'[SmallWM](https://github.com/adamnew123456/SmallWM)' project.
A few small changes were made for my own use, most notably replacing Doxygen 
with CMake. Other than that the changes are very minimal. This isn't a serious 
project, just something I personally use for my desktop rice.
